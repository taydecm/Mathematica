Sinai Billiard Simulation in Mathematica

This project implements a numerical simulation of the Sinai billiard, a classical model in dynamical systems that exhibits chaotic behavior.
The simulation was developed in Wolfram Mathematica and allows visualization of particle trajectories inside a square billiard table with a circular obstacle in the center.

Features:

Simulation of particle motion with elastic collisions

Visualization of trajectories and phase space

Adjustable initial conditions (position, velocity, radius of obstacle)

Exploration of chaotic dynamics in deterministic systems

Background:
The Sinai billiard is a fundamental example in the study of chaos and ergodic theory. A particle moves freely inside a square domain, reflecting elastically on the boundaries and on a circular scatterer. Despite its deterministic rules, the system shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

Requirements:

Wolfram Mathematica 12.0 or higher
